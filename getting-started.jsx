			<h2 className='text'>What are Eggs, Exactly?</h2>
			<hr />
			<br />
			<p className='text'>In this game, there are a number of strange, mysterious and downright weird creatures that you can train and battle with. Each one has its own quirks, be they a punny inspiration, strange roles in battle, or unique one-of-a-kind features that no other creature possesses. What they all have in common though, are eggs - they all come from the same small set of eggs, which can be purchased from the shop page.</p>
			<h2 className='text'>Buying Your First Eggs</h2>
			<hr />
			<br />
			<p className='text'>To begin the game, you'll need to buy a pair of eggs from the shop - the shop has a small selection from the overall pool of eggs, which rotates every day. It also has some other useful items, but at first you'll need to focus on buying common eggs.</p>
			<p className='text'>You'll begin the game with 500 silver, which is enough to buy a pair of common eggs - which ones you select are up to you. Once you've purchased your eggs, you can find them on the eggs page.</p>
			<h2 className='text'>Hatching Your Eggs</h2>
			<hr />
			<br />
			<p className='text'>When you created your account, you were automatically gifted a pair of items, as well - an incubator, and a battle box (we'll come back to the battle box later). For now, the eggs can be &quot;hatched&quot; from the eggs page - you'll see the option by hovering your cursor over the selected egg. Hatching an egg is a slow process - each one takes 10 minutes. You'll eventually be able to speed up this process with a second incubator, but for now patience is key.</p>
			<p className='text'>Make sure you hatch two eggs - you'll find the newly hatched creatures on the creatures page.</p>
			<h2 className='text'>Creatures in Depth</h2>
			<hr />
			<br />
			<p className='text'>Once you have some creatures, you'll be able to inspect them from the creatures page by hovering over them and clicking &quot;inspect&quot;.</p>
			<p className='text'>From here, you'll be given a number of options, including the ability to train them, breed them or release them; you can also assign up to four techniques to use in battle here, and move the creature into a battle box. To retreive a creature from a battle box, you'll need to go to the battle box inspect page, hover over a creature and select &quot;remove&quot;.</p>
			<p className='text'>Finally, back in the creature inspect page, you'll notice that there's text instructing you that you'll need a magnifying glass to properly inspect the creatures - don't worry, this is just to ease you into the mechanics of the game slowly. Once you have purchased a magnifying glass, you'll be able to see the statistics of the creature directly, including its genetics, inherent abilities and it's training progress.</p>
			<h2 className='text'>Breeding Creatures</h2>
			<hr />
			<br />
			<p className='text'>At this point, you need to set your two creatures to breed - make sure BOTH creatures are breeding - it takes two to tango, after all. A few times a day, if the creatures are breeding, a new egg will appear on the eggs page. What kind of egg it is is determined by a few factors that are a loosely guarded secret.</p>
			<p className='text'>Once you have a few eggs, you can continue to hatch them, or sell them back to the shop - selling eggs is the primary way of gaining silver, which can be used to buy rarer eggs, as well as other useful items.</p>
			<h2 className='text'>Premium Items</h2>
			<hr />
			<br />
			<p className='text'>It should be noted that this game has a premium currency called &quot;gold&quot;, purchasable for real world cash, which can be used to buy some exclusive items. These items are not required to play at all, and simply enable more kinds of gameplay. The premium items have a gold border in the shop page.</p>
			<p className='text'>Please don't feel obliged to buy gold - rather, if you enjoy this game, then you have the option of supporting the developer and gaining some perks, such as extra simultanous battles. Developing and hosting this game isn't free, after all.</p>
			<h2 className='text'>Next Steps</h2>
			<hr />
			<br />
			<p className='text'>Once you have the Magnifying glass, then it's time to move onto the next article - Training for battle.</p>
