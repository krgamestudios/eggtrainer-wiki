## Available Styling

Some CSS classes are available for use in the wiki. They are:

| class | description |
|---|---|
| page | Don't use this - this is exclusively for the wiki page as a whole, and is already applied by default.
| panel | For various sections, when you feel like it's appropriate. Most wiki pages can be written without it, though.
| text | Indicates written text.
| left | Justify text left (applies to the text class).
| centered | Justify text centered (applies to the text class). Can also apply to other things, like panels.
| right | Justify text right (applies to the text class).
| middle | Justify contents vertically in the middle.
| table | Apply this to the outer-most container for a flexbox table, usually a div.
| row | Apply this to the individual row container for a flexbox table, usually a div.
| col | Apply this to the indivudual cells for a flexbox table, usually a div.
